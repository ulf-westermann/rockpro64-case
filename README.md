# rockpro64-case

A 3D printable case for the PINE64 ROCKPro64 single board computer. Designed with OpenSCAD.

It is large enough to house the PCI-E NVMe SSD interface card. The openings are large to access all ports and to allow for sufficient air flow for passive cooling. Use self-tapping 3x10 mm screws for mounting the PCB and lid.
